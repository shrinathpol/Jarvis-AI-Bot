# Offline Model Trainer

This project is designed to train an offline machine learning model using data processed from an online model. The goal is to create a robust offline model that can make predictions without requiring an internet connection.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd offline_model_trainer
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the project settings in `config.yaml` as needed.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the `data_processing.py` module to load and preprocess your datasets.
- Train the model by running the `model_training.py` script.
- After training, use `offline_inference.py` to make predictions with the trained model.
- For insights and visualizations, refer to the `data_exploration.ipynb` notebook.
